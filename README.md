# Introduction

The focus of the development of IPFS to date has been primarily on desktop and server-class hardware. However, the growth of the internet for more than a decade has been almost entirely on mobile devices. Smartphone use has eclipsed desktop, especially in emerging markets, where IPFS stands best to address use cases, patterns and concerns around data sovereignty, offline applications and security.

This growth at the furthest edge of the network requires solutions at the edge. While the IPFS network continues to grow on mobile \(for instance, IPFS now has default support on Opera for Android\), more research is needed to realise the full value of the network. IPFS should be directly available and accessible to end-users on all their devices - and the design of IPFS integrations should make this clear and easy to use. To create that level of clarity, developers need clear guidelines that align with user needs while unlocking all the power of the decentralised mobile web.

These guidelines comprise of two main parts, research and design. The research consists of [context setting](context/considerations-for-mobile.md), [application surveys](application-survey/application-survey/) and [user research](user-research/interviews/). The design covers [strategy](design/design-strategy.md), defining [workshop](design/design-workshop.md), design [principles](design/principles/) and [scenarios](design/scenarios/) showing examples of the design of IPFS for mobile apps in practice. Both include investigation and exploration of more extensive mobile sharing and receiving workflows of iOS and Android mobile operating systems. These guidelines provide a foundational effort towards IPFS on mobile platforms, informing both IPFS feature prioritisation as well as ecosystem and community building on the protocol.

## Application Survey Findings

After in-depth review, we came upon many approaches to core areas that current P2P apps all share, such as identity and it's management, connection notification, confirmations and how they approach onboarding and user education.

## User Research Findings

There is a lot of opportunity in addressing userâ€™s desires for better methods of files sharing and the addressing their frustrations with its management and an increasing interest in privacy and security issues.

## Design Principles

Apps and services for mobile aren't reformatted desktop apps. They need to take into account a host of different issues, from battery life to signal. Likewise, mobile apps are much different in other ways and apps on IPFS can provide unique and key benefits like privacy and speed. Onboarding and educating the user though should be subtle and avoid deep technical explanations. Users also want assurance that they have some level of privacy or security so their data and files are safe as much as they need help managing files. Finally, apps built on IPFS need to be seamless not only with managing connections but how the app works with their established habits and patterns.

## Design Scenarios

When a user gets started with an app or service, they only need to know IPFS works and provides a better way of handling data. Things need to be simple, so utilise users' existing methods and interactions. This goes beyond file transfer to managing file access as well. IPFS's unique abilities to not need centralised Internet access to transfer files can help offline users as well as provide safe means for helping users contact and connect with one another.
