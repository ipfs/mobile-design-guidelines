# Mobile Design Guidelines

Following on the far-reaching initial efforts to bring about mass adoption of IPFS by creating browser design guidelines to be brought to standards bodies and browser vendors, it is clear the guidelines work needs to be expanded to where it could achieve adoption quickest, on mobile. Smartphone use has eclipsed desktop, especially in emerging markets, where IPFS stands to better address use cases, patterns and concerns around data sovereignty, offline applications and security.

This programme of work will be the first of two, including research and design phases. Both will include not just use of mobile browser but wider mobile sharing and receiving workflows of iOS and Android mobile operating systems. This will provide a foundational effort towards IPFS on mobile platforms, informing both IPFS feature prioritization and the ecosystem and community building on the protocol.
