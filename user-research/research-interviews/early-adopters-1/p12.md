## Key findings

* Uses cloud services like Google Drive because its free and use a lot, but once hits limits like 15GB opens a new email for more space
* Files on HD can get corrupted so now uses cloud backup
* When working with teams and various parties with sending and viewing files, security and granular permissions are an issue and requires a lot of work and paying attention. Uses DocSend where can create data rooms and decide when there is access or not
* Moving around lots and files and file management is always a struggle how to find and adjust as you grow
* Filing system and naming systems to be able to find everything if managing is important
