# P11

## Key findings

* There is a large issues with the value of the data storing and what sharing and it has to be easier to share to make it worth it
* p2p should be widely used but nobody using it
* There could be a network effect if there was a work use case such as if teams used it
* Mac AirDrop very intuitive users should be able to use p2p when sharing content and not need to know the person
* Uses reset password 50% of the time to login
* Wallets and things like key management of ID based on wallet with control levels not widely use outside of crypto but what would be needed
* Digital IDs are super complicated and maybe easy at first but very complex when people forget or things go wrong
* Social recovery should be a feature but has to be designed well
* The biggest challenge is adoption. There is no incentive to switch, it takes a big network to make it happen.
