## Key findings

* P2P technologies such as IPFS have had a difficult time in user adoption
* Many developers believe battery life and signal to be vital to end-users
* Users might know of P2P but don't want to be aware that they are using it
* P2P is assumed to be useful for users concerned about privacy and security
* Offline-first is a trend that is important but difficult to push forward There is a lot of design work to be done, mainly around status and notifications
* Identity is essential to both users and developers but is hard to explain and develop for
* Ideally, the user should have siloed data, not application silos Cloud services like Dropbox and OS applications like AirDrop are considered the gold standard for file sharing
