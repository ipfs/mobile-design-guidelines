# Early Adopters

## Key findings

### Interface and Interaction

* Notifications should not be overwhelming and let the user know what is going on
* Managing files and structure is essential to the user
* Syncing via cloud services and sending messages notifications are very important

### Data and security

* Single Sign-On is a good thing but how to manage it and be secure is not a simple thing
* Torrent use in the past was widespread, but in general, P2P is not used anymore
* File security and backup is paramount, but it is less important who has the final file
* Cloud services like Google products are easy to use but not trusted
* Identity management is difficult even for advanced users
* Privacy and security is crucial but how to manage it is challenging, varied and often put off till later
