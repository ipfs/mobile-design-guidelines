# Considerations for mobile

### Mobile browsers

One extenuating factor with browsers on mobile devices is their limited feature set. While browsers on desktop are often already feature rich, they also feature extensions and add-ons, many of which enable additional features not readily available in the base install. This is important for a number of reasons, first of which is that it means that anyone developing p2p applications, can not easily do this through the pre-installed browsers such as Chrome (Android) and Safari (iOS) on the two most dominant platforms. The mobile ecosystem has developed as such over the past decade to be app-centric and this means that when developing for mobile in general, much effort is geared towards developing native apps. However, this trend shows some pushback recently with movement away from native apps and trying to make the mobile web more powerful, such as through Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
