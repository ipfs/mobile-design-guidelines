# Key differences from the Browser Design Guidelines

The previous IPFS Browser Design Guidelines served as guide for desktop browser designers and standards bodies such as the IETF and the W3C to aid in implementing IPFS natively in browsers. This is the first effort to research and design how IPFS could best serve users and gain adoption broadly using what is the first and most universal distribution mechanism which is the browser.

The Mobile Design Guidelines are the follow on effort to reach even more users by examining use cases and scenarios where mobile handsets, the most widely networked device available today, can be used for IPFS readily and easily. While mobile use includes the use of a browser, mobile presents a number of challenges for IPFS adoption, not only in terms of the native apps centricity of the two dominant handset operating systems Android and iOS, but due to the limits of access to and the extensibility of those operating systems and default mobile browsers.
