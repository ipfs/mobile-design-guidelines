# Findings

The apps featured are divided into three main groups all using P2P, which include file sharing, messaging and group posting. Many of the apps we looked at fit into two or more of these categories, typically messaging and group posting and their feature sets reflect this by combining methods and interactions.

After a more in-depth review, we came upon many approaches to core areas that they all share, such as identity and it's management, connection notification, confirmations and how they approach onboarding and user education.

## ManyVerse

* Connection status is not shown when the user logs in, they need to go to Connections screen
* Identity and accounts not handled with a typical login and password
* Syncing status of content is not made apparent to the user
* There is no logout option unless the user closes the app
* Users can be connected to and sent images without confirmation
* When a new account is setup, there is no indication to the user that the account has been setup successfully

## Sharedrop

* Users are made aware of privacy and connection implications with sharing
* Users present on the network are each given a unique avatar and anonymous name
