# Research Interviews

## [Experts](experts/)

Interviews started with the Experts cohort. All of these people have or had direct experience with IPFS or with similar P2P technologies. All had a great deal of technical knowledge and interesting insights into key niche applications such as offline-first and emerging markets development.

## [Early Adopters](early-adopters-1/)

The Early Adopters cohort all worked in fields adjacent to IPFS and P2P, for instance in blockchain, decentralisation, research, data privacy and security, and provided particularly poignant views and perspective on developing technologies and bridging them to users.

## [Potential Users](potential-users/)

Potential Users were between Europe and Africa and all smart phone users and specifically recruited as not having any specialist knowledge or work experience in the tech and software fields. However, all had at least some knowledge or passing familiarity with P2P and cloud services such as Dropbox and Google Drive. The Potential Users cohort are non-technical users intersted in better file sharing solutions that would work better for everyone.
