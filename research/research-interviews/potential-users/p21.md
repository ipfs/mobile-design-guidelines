# P21

## Key findings

* Deals with unstable networks so does as much as can over wifi so alternates and switches networks and connections a lot
* Just know that when shares something that it goes to person and would not say that not worried but doesn’t really know what happens
* Heard of p2p and understands it to be a connection between two parties through a channel like a computer to computer directly without a server
* Doesn’t really look at battery since always changing phones and always has battery packs because wouldn’t want transaction to fail
* Likes that GDrive is safe and doesn’t dislike anything also Dropbox
* Never thought about that someone will never be able to get to files that are shared via cloud services and confident they will be there
* Mostly concerned with network delays because it is embarrassing when things are not received or delivery delayed
