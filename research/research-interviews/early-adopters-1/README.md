# Early Adopters

## Key findings

* The user should know what is going on and notifications should be just enough and not overwhelming
* Being able to manage files and structure is important to the user and cloud services typically reflect this
* Battery life is important but not as much as it used to be
* Single Sign On is viewed as a good thing but how to manage it securely is not a simple thing
* P2P was used extensively in terms of torrents but generally not recently
* Syncing via cloud services and sending messages notifications are seen as very important
* File security and backup is very important, but less so is who has the final file
* Cloud services like Google products are easy to use but not to be trusted
* Identity management is difficult even for advanced users
* Privacy and security is important but how to manage it is difficult, varied and often put off
