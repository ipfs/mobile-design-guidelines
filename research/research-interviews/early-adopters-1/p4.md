# P4

## Key findings

* Privacy is a right and so is the ability to manage a secure identity
* Cloud services are not to be trusted and P2P can give us ways to do our own private hosting of files and apps, but there are high barriers to entry with platforms development
* Battery life and bandwidth is not a big deal because of phone upgrades
* Sharing from Phone only important in crisis
* Biometrics is a good idea as its already out there and you canâ€™t take it back. But \(private\) keys should be locked to face/fingerprint
* Prefer single sign on but only if on  a blockchain or locally that could be accessed only through biometrics or guardians
