# P10

## Key findings

* Cloud services like Google products are easy to use but not to be trusted
* At this point just use less apps because don’t want more IDs and then need to worry about privacy and this is a lot of work
* Want not just easy UX, but want some sort of P2P support for when things go wrong and wonders where the responsibility is with peers?
* You want to own your own storage but it needs to be usable
* P2P doesn’t do anything special or more than Dropbox and can’t see tangible benefits how would make life better
* Hard to switch, that’s the main problem, should be just a button and ordinarily configuration is a nightmare
