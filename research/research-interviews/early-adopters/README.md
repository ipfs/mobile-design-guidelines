### Key findings

* P2P technologies such as IPFS have had a difficult time in user adoption
* Battery life and signal are thought to be very important to end users
* Users might know of P2P but don't want to be aware that they are using it
* P2P is assumed to be good for users concerned about privacy and security
* Offline-first is a trend that is important but difficult to push forward
* There is a lot of design work to be done, largely around status and notifications
* Identity is important to both users and developers but is hard to explain and develop for
* Ideally the user should have siloed data not application silos
* Cloud services like Dropbox and OS applications like AirDrop are considered the gold standard for file sharing
