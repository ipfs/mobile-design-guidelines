# P2

## Key findings

* There is a lot of ground work being done on switching between connections and making it seamless
* There is no single framework for developing IPFS on both Android and iOS
* Berty is working mainly on chat and using messages with attachments and plan to implement  IPFS on mobile
* Not a lot of people using Berty apps at the moment
* There are a lot of interesting projects like Anytype.io and Cosmos where you can already share via p2p
* People want decentralisation without server like Mastodon and will be a big trend in next months to one year
* Offline first next big trend and this will be led by countries without good bandwidth and/or censorship
* There is UX work to be done, largely around status and notifications with connection and visuals representing that
