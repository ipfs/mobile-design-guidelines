## Key findings

* Never sends a big file with mobile
* Never confused that stored in cloud, and sometimes don’t necessarily want it or have room on device, while cloud services have more space than phone or computer
* Trusts safe on cloud in terms of it being there, but doesn’t trust things are private
* Hates cloud by default and even if delete it, it won’t necessarily be deleted everywhere
* No service tells which way is faster, LTE or Wifi for example
* Never use single sign on, Google knows everything already but just a feeling that don’t like helping it along
