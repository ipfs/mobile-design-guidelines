### Key findings

* Torrent is interesting see what files are healthy and when it come down but Usenet has better UX because it aggregates and then download later
* Usenet also has a monetisation where  pay for no restrictions
* Lots of problems with dead files and connections and need to go to forums to show if file healthy or not
* Pays attention to status messages on client has for NextCloud setup that has for self use because don’t like limitations on how much space has online - can expand 10GB in closet and data is his to control
* Use NextCloud on phone core uses digital vault with pic of every doc has and browse through videos and want to watch and stream videos - no room on phone so doesn’t download
* Different logins for everything and uses password manager and hope blockchain adoption will change this
* Wants private key on USB stick and not managed on phone but maybe have as secondary backup
