# P15

## Key findings

* First target for DAT was scientists and universities because their DAT p2p protocol doesn’t address content on the network. This is an issue because scientists want to control data until published and then be able to change or redact things.
* During the co-design of DAT past 5 years the biggest request was for offline sync and no servers
* Ideally can use Bluetooth for media exchange and there are some experimental apps but never saw it actually work - Briar, Bridgify, ManyVerse might but not sure
* Ideally P2P users would not have to setup any infrastructure
* Mesh networks are insufficient and nobody can repair them, especially in rural areas
* Data stored locally on device when syncing has to have progress and show notifications about to synchronise with the other person, they might have a huge amount and you have to know ahead of time before sync handshake - it should be consent-based
* Methods work for the wider internet, when get a request to sync and notify this IP wants to connect
* Described p2p lots of way and with metaphors for instance syncing is like a good kind of computer virus it want to get to all the computers
* Intentionality and not auto-syncing since you can get data you didn’t mean to
* Want an Open Source AirDrop because it just works
* Need sync history and device names and would notify ideally what you synced “this person deleted 120 photos…”
* Dropbox had a huge problem when people were giving out access and other people later deleting things. There is a huge need for people to be able to revert
* Really crucial to not add another box. PL should talk to companies and have IPFS built into things like routers and boxes we already have instead
