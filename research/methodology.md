# Methodology

## Mobile Survey Review

The Mobile Survey Review is comprised of two parts. The first is an examination of mobile browsers  and is intended to look at potential uses of the browser on mobile devices for IPFS. Following the browser survey was the Mobile Application Survey which took into account a review of a wide range of mobile applications, both native apps and mobile web apps, and all of which the network transport used is P2P.

## Kick-off Workshop

An expert/stakeholder workshop was conducted in to help focus the recruiting of  expert, early adopter and potential user interviews as well as to prioritise the problem space in relevant technology and possible solutions.

## Research Interviews

Research interviews have been split between three cohorts, the first of which are Experts. Experts are people who’ve worked on IPFS or similar technologies and have a great deal of technical and top-level insights and experience in developing P2P technologies for users.

Simultaneously, Early Adopters were interviewed to understand in which directions the adoption of IPFS on mobile might or should go. Working on related fields such as blockchain, decentralisation, research, data privacy and security, they were uniquely positioned to give educated opinions and foresight in how to translate the knowledge and developments of experts into what might work for users.

Finally, we’ve begun talking to Potential Users, who are mobile phone users recruited for having had smart phone, P2P and cloud services experience, and are spread between varying geographies and demographics. These future users will help guide the design phase of the Mobile Design Guidelines and the design of features, patterns and standards to enable P2P and IPFS to gain widespread acceptance and adoption.
