To direct the research, the interviews needed to be framed from a point of assumptions from stakeholder correspondence and workshops from where the research could investigate where things could potentially go.

* Users have a certain set of primary functions for which they use their mobile devices which differ from the same activities on the desktop

* Besides sharing through messaging, cloud services are the standard by which users understand files and media going between different users
* Users are aware of privacy, but their understanding and approaches to it vary drastically
* Infrastructural services on mobile devices, such as battery life and bandwidth are important to all users
