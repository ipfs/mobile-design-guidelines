# Research Summaries

IPFS on mobile presents a unique set of challenges with mobile use and expectations from users. Much of this seems to stem from a high standard of usability and maturity of cloud service syncing platforms as well as well as their ubiquity. However, there is a lot of opportunity in addressing userâ€™s desires for better methods of files sharing and the addressing their frustrations with its management and an increasing interest in privacy and security issues.

## Cloud Services and Syncing

* **Cloud services like Dropbox and applications like AirDrop are considered the gold standard for file sharing**
* Cloud services are thought of as stable and dependable, but they are also questioned in terms of their intents and longevity
* Being able to manage files and structure is important to the user and cloud services may not reflect this
* Various types of media, such as photos, videos and audio files are used extensively on mobile devices but how they are shared varies widely
* **File security and backup is very important, but less so is who has the final file**
* Cloud services like Google products are easy to use but not necessarily trusted
* Notifications about syncing and status are seen as very important
* P2P was used extensively in terms of torrents but generally not recently

## P2P usability and awareness

* P2P technologies such as IPFS have had a difficult time in mass user adoption
* **Users might know of P2P but don't want to be aware that they are using it**
* P2P is understood as a concept relatively easily but there is some difficulty in imagining actively using it
* **The user should know what is going on and notifications should be just enough and not overwhelming**
* Battery and signal strength are important only generally when lacking
* Battery life is not as important as it used to be
* Offline-first is a trend that is important but difficult to push forward to mass adoption

## Security and identity

* Identity and its management is understood to be important but is generally thought of as difficult and so many times ignored, even for advanced users
* **There is a general awareness of privacy, but its understanding and application are understood differently in different parts of the world**
* Single Sign On is viewed as a good thing but how to manage it securely is not a simple thing
