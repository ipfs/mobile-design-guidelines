# Findings

Design is also a research exercise. Through designing interactions, interfaces and services we can discover and realise things we couldn't just by interviewing people or reviewing materials and literature. Design expresses what comes out of research and elaborates and asserts user needs. These findings from the IPFS mobile design explorations often overlap but can be roughly grouped into three categories. The first is how the information comes through to the user. Then is how the visual components of the interface display that. Finally is how their interactions help make it all happen. All of these findings help further the development of mobile apps and services using IPFS.

### Information

* Users can share photos, media and files in numerous ways but they need to understand that it will happen how they think it will
* The app needs to be supportive but just when the user might need it to be
* Showing confirmations aren't the only way an app or service can inform the user about status and what is happening
* Benefits shoud be focused on during onboarding as quickly as possible
* It's difficult to inform and not overwhelm the user with notifications and requires a thoroughly tested mix
* How P2P works or why it's better doesn't need to be explained in detail
* The success and understanding of apps is largely down to how stable and dependable they are which needs to be communicated
* Accounts need to provide a lot of extra value in order to be worth people signing up

### Interface

* Showing the file is safe is paramount and expressed by showing it is held also locally
* The user should know that the file is safe and that can be done very subtly
* QR codes can be integrated well but you have to tell the user what they are and what to do with them
* The interface needs to show who has access to what
* Offline status needs to be indicated as lightly as possible
* Time and cost can be addressed with progress bars and time estimates
* IPFS links should be shown as well as ways to view in app
* Settings need to be as minimal as possible
* Status is always a challenge of showing too much or too little
* There are challenges to designing around showing that things might not work due to things such as battery or signal strength

### Interaction

* Cloud services such as DropBox and Google Drive are useful for showing how many existing patterns are used
* There are some things like recovery seed phrases that are prevalent for a reason - there aren't many alternatives
* We need to design around the infrastructure of the mobile experience which is signal and battery, but this requires knowledge of technical as well as usability issues
* File management should follow usual conventions
* Discoverability is extremely hard with secure apps but can be approached by giving users controls and settings to handle that
* The user should have options and information about push and publish and when it is happening
* Identity can be done lightly by not requiring emails and phone numbers but this leaves the user in a spot where they have to be extra paranoid about recovery
* Offline local collaboration methods can be made simple and quick and could thus become more popular
