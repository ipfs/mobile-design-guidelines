# A user manages their chat identity

The Scenarios are to help designers and developers with situations they are likely to encounter when creating mobile apps and services for IPFS. Note, the order of the scenarios does not imply priority.

Each scenario shows an example of a how mobile apps and services using IPFS could work. Each scenario also has a prototypical user in mind. These persona-users are archetypes that are composites of users discovered in the research. The purpose of these is establishing design and feature sets focused on user needs.

An illustrated user flow with screens show how an app or service could express the scenario. The interaction and component design of these flows is not intended to be prescriptive. It is to help show how apps on IPFS could or should be designed. This is then followed by design considerations which summarise each scenario. Likewise, these are helpful hints to keep in mind when designing and building.

In these examples of mobile interfaces, there is an abstracted operating system. It is not iOS or Android, but an amalgam. This is to avoid bias in design for either operating system and develop patterns that work for both. App X and App Y in the Scenarios are fictitious and serve as an example to show how the interactions would work.
