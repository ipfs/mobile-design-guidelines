# Design Strategy

The target in developing and growing the IPFS user base is mass adoption. This target, however, is continuously shifting and changing as the technology landscape changes month by month, year by year. There are substantial shifts and stable trends, namely mobile and mobile internet use, which continue to grow globally. IPFS if it is to succeed needs to be where people will use it and that is clearly on their smartphones.

IPFS is uniquely positioned to expand in user adoption. As IPFS matures and the community grows, how exactly users should be involved in and use IPFS in their digital lives is now ready to be looked at in earnest. The P2P market is hidden, and most users of it, whether with torrents or AirDrop, may not know they’re even using it. It is becoming clear that users worldwide are now ready for the idea of a usable P2P where their identities and files are safe from tracking and exploitation.

The IPFS Mobile Design Guidelines are an essential step in making widespread adoption a reality. The guidelines will provide a bridge between user needs discovered in research to design patterns, components and methods designers and developers can use to build IPFS applications. The guidelines can provide a basis for an expanding community moving towards more and better applications that help people.

The guidelines need to be translated to design. The results and key findings from the Mobile Survey Review, the research interviews, workshop and desk research were distilled and synthesised into the Key Design Questions that will address this.

### Key Design Questions

* How might IPFS Mobile work seamlessly with other mobile devices and the desktop?
* How might IFPS Mobile be perceived as being a solid service users can trust that will be worth the time investment in learning and continuing to use?
* How might IPFS Mobile provide even better file management than existing cloud services?
* How might IPFS Mobile support media files?
* How might users be supported in knowing if necessary, “where” a file might be and who can access it?
* How might we design notifications to best support users in their awareness of syncing and sharing status?
* Should we hide from users the fact that IPFS on mobile is a P2P network?
* How might IPFS Mobile show through setup and interaction how it works and why it’s beneficial?
* How might users be made aware that their use of IPFS Mobile will not create problems with battery life?
* How might we show users offline functionality in their regular use in IPFS Mobile?
* How might setting up and managing identity on IPFS Mobile be as easy as on cloud services?
* How might privacy and its implications and advantages be explained well with IPFS Mobile?
* Can onboarding to IPFS Mobile be made quick and educational?

### Next Steps in Design

The design guidelines to follow are to provide the necessary components and interaction and interface design frameworks to the IPFS community. This will unify thinking and best practices to make the broader efforts of a safer, faster, more open Internet a reality for users. It is only through consistent and collaborative efforts will the community and the user base grow, and thus IPFS succeed.

What we need to look towards is an iterative, staged approach in moving towards establishing IPFS as a viable, usable and sustainable ecosystem for the majority of file sending and sharing users with smartphones. What follows is how this will be accomplished.

* Workshop with Protocol Labs to help translate the research into design and prioritise design efforts
* Interaction and user experience design work to solve the researched issues, mapping out user flows, design patterns and use cases
* Designs including recommendations, iconographic, interaction and screen treatments for IPFS in mobile browsers and mobile OS’s in graphic format in the final report as well as Sketch and PDF assets in the repository
* User experience flows in graphic format in the final report as well as Sketch and PDF assets in the repository
* Design guidelines and component design to inform and help further development efforts in graphic format in the final report as well as Sketch and PDF assets in the repository
* User interface, component and elements design
* Interaction design and production of user flows and use cases
* Design guidelines creation and documentation
* Documentation of surveys and collection of research and design materials
* Guidelines analysis
* Compilation of assets and writing of documentation with development recommendations

The guidelines will serve as a constant and living guide to the evolving problem space and give the IPFS community something to remember who and what they are designing and building for. These are meant as guides, not as design diktat, and will provide enough direction yet flexibility to be able to support different implementations and versions of IPFS applications working towards the same goal of a usable, growing and sustainable ecosystem.
