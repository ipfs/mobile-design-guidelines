# Principles

The Principles provide an overarching rationale to the design of mobile apps and services that use IPFS. These principles cover the broad gamut of issues designers and developers might encounter. These are suggestions for designers and developers when building their apps and services.

Each starts with analysis taken from the [research](https://app.gitbook.com/@jkosem/s/ipfs-mobile-guidelines/user-research/interviews). This analysis serves as a basis for deeper considerations for designers and developers. Each principle in turn includes Do’s and Don’ts on how to make it happen and an illustration of what it could look like.
