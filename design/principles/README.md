# Principles

When designing and developing apps for IPFS on mobile, it is good to remember some common principles that apply across the whole spectrum of apps that can be built. These principles are meant as guides and patterns for design, not instruction.



### Make IPFS invisible most of the time

The user does not need to know that they are even using IPFS, or even P2P for that matter. What they need to be aware of through their use, is that something built to work with IPFS benefits them in terms of security, speed potentially and control.

### Be seamless

The user shouldn't know how they're connected necessarily, whether through wifi, bluetooth or otherwise. They should just feel confident that data is getting through, not how.

### Be supportive about what is happening, not prevalent

Mobile users are already overwhelmed with notifications. They need to be able to know what is going on, but not all the time. Many times they only need to know when something has gone wrong or could go wrong soon.

### Don't overwhelm with information

Long, technical explanations should be avoided in interfces. Instead, provide clear and short descriptions of how the technology of the app or service works in a special section the user doesn't see all the time. During onboarding only show once if possible the most important information the user actually needs to know when starting to use the app.

### Help manage files

Mobile apps and services need to help manage files by respecting user needs with availability, discoverability and persistence. This also includes helping them know they have a complete copy, even offline of the files.

### Respect the device

Apps and services for mobile aren't reframed or reformatted desktop apps, they need to take into account a host of different issues, from battery life to signal availability and strength. Assume the user will at some point have issues with these.

### Learn from and improve on web2 instead of disregarding it

Much has been done in the past decade or so with the development of web2 and app-native design practices. It is important to understand users and how used they are to certain conventions which have evolved because they work for people.
