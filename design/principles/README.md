# Principles

The Principles provide an overarching rationale to the design of mobile apps and services that use IPFS. These principles cover the broad gamut of issues designers and developers might encounter. These are suggestions for designers and developers when building their apps and services.

Each starts with analysis taken from the [research](https://app.gitbook.com/@jkosem/s/ipfs-mobile-guidelines/user-research/interviews). This analysis serves as a basis for deeper considerations for designers and developers. Each principle in turn includes Do’s and Don’ts on how to make it happen and an illustration of what it could look like.

## Respect the device

Apps and services for mobile aren't reformatted desktop apps. They need to take into account a host of different issues, from battery life to signal.

## Explain, don't overwhelm

Stategically highlight the unique and key benefits like privacy and speed that other apps not on IPFS don't have. Avoid long, technical explanations in interfaces.

## Make privacy work for the user

There is no shortage of concern about privacy and security for all levels of users. What users want is assurance that they have some level of privacy or security so their data and files are safe.

## Give control over data

Mobile apps and services should help manage files. They can do this by respecting the needs users may have with availability, discoverability and persistence.

## Be seamless

The user shouldn't necessarily know how they're connected, whether through wifi, bluetooth or otherwise. They should just feel confident that data is getting sent and received, not how.
