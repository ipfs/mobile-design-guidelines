# Make IPFS invisible most of the time

The user does not need to know that they are even using IPFS, or even P2P for that matter. What they need to be aware of through their use, is that something built to work with IPFS benefits them in terms of security, speed potentially and control.

## What the research points to

* Users don't typically concerned about how an app or service works, just that it does and does well
* Mobile users have a great deal of cognitive load when using apps from multiple and sometimes competing notifications and pervasive partial attention

## What to think about

IPFS is a file system. Most users don't have many day to day concerns about what file system they are using, just that it works and works how they want it to.

IPFS should be the secure and dependable basis your app or service relies on that hums surely and quietly in the background. It is there to provide many key and unique benefits other apps don't which should be highlighted, but out of the way.
