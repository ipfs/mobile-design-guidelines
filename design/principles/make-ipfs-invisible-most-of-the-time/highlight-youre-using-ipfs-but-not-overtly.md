# Highlight you're using IPFS but not overtly

Mobile apps and services typically have short but frequent interaction periods. If it is not a reading or research app, you should not have a lot for them to read. The user has a small screen and not a lot of time, so put additional or technical information somewhere accessible but out of the way.

IPFS is a relatively new technology and difficult to understand. P2P is much older but not prevalent in conversation even in technical contexts. The user can be made aware they are using it, but they shouldn't be necessarily reminded of it.

| âœ… Do | ðŸš« Don't |
| :--- | :--- |
| Show that your app or service is using IPFS in the information or credits screen | Show everywhere information about the underlying protocols |
| Show the IPFS logo and "Made with IPFS" in the info or credits screen | Have in-depth explanations of how IPFS works in main transactional screens |

### **Example**

_Show how to follow this in practice with interactions, etc._
