# Mobile Application Survey

The spread of applications in the P2P space on mobile is sparse, but this could be to limit testing to only fully released software versions available on app stores or through mobile web. The chosen applications in the Mobile Survey all share P2P as the transport layer but vary drastically in feature sets, showing some areas to investigate use patterns.

## [ManyVerse](manyverse.md)

* Available on both iOS and Android
* At first glance simple to use, however once the user gets into it navigation and the logic of the app can become very confusing
* Account handling is unclear and there is little in-app instruction as to how user profiles are stored
* Appears to be able to do as it says which is online-offline syncing of messages and content and media in images which can be useful
* Connecting to other users is difficult and unclear

## [Sharedrop](sharedrop.io.md)

* Web app only, although works in most mobile browsers
* Confusing avatars sometimes seem to reload differently making choosing shares confusing
* File transfer of a 2MB photo was instantaneous
* Would probably work better as a native app but very good that does not require any accounts or install to use
* Could be hard to use for some users to follow and understand what is going on in the sharing work flow

## [Status](status.md)

* Solid and user friendly blockchain app which enables relatively inexperienced users to get started with blockchain dApps
* While the sign-on process is typical and smooth for a blockchain app, it might be confusing to those who just wish to use P2P without public and private keys and maintaining them
* Chat is solid and user friendly and has discoverability as well
* Any transferring of files can only take place with a loaded dApp in the Browser, meaning Status does not have file transfer functionality built in
* Might benefit from allowing users to share things directly through a native function or perhaps through Chat.

## [FrostWire](frostwire.md)

* Relatively simple and solid torrent application that works well on mobile
* Android only
* Freemium model with the app ad-supported unless upgraded to a month by month, 6 month or yearly terms. Also has a 30 minutes free with 1 video ad play
* Useful for mobile downloads of music and video, but probably not for teams use and collaboration

## [uTorrent Mobile](utorrent-mobile.md)

* Simple torrenting app which seems at the outset as simple enough to use
* Search is not integrated into the app, but instead is overall very user unfriendly use of an integrated browser doing blanket search
* Downloading isn't consistent and sometimes requires the user to copy and paste the torrent link and then add through the app manually
* The main navigation on the bottom is misleading as the Video and Music links do not search for or list Video and Music, but are filters for local files
* DLive is featured in the main, bottom navigation but is not an integrated feature that allows downloading or sharing of files but a live video stream site which features no torrent downloading or sharing

## [Haven](haven.md)

* Haven is a well designed and user-friendly app that does away with a lot of the upfront key and profile management often present in apps involving P2P purchases and cryptocurrency wallets.
* There are multiple places in the app where the user can sell, post, chat and pay which might be confusing for some
* Chats can be initiated with anyone without invites or acceptances which could be a privacy concern for many users
* Many of the interaction patterns follow Google Material design system which is well known to many mobile users, although it does as well on iOS which might be confusing to those used to native iOS patterns
* Haven does not present the user with a lot of information or details upfront on the P2P technology used, including IPFS, to the user which reduces cognitive load in using the app, but presents it in terms of general safety and privacy actions

## [Fairdrop](fairdrop.md)

* Simple method of interaction
* It is not clear what is involved with accounts and signup for accounts without the user going through the process
* Does not give the user an option to use OS level integrated method \(SMS, email, etc.\) to send the link once the file is sent
