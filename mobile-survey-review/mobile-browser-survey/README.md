# Mobile Browser Survey

To investigate mobile P2P interaction for IPFS we surveyed the two most prominent and widely used mobile browsers, Android's Chrome and iOS's Safari, both of which are the default browsers, and thus most likely to be used. It is important to note that neither has support for extensions or add-ons, which would allow bringing P2P directly to mobile potentially drastically easier.
