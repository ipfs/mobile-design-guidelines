# Mobile Browser Survey

We surveyed the two most prominent and widely used mobile browsers, Android's Chrome and iOS's Safari, both of which are the default browsers of their respective operating systems, as they are browsers users have most likely used. We have surveyed these browsers to understand the mobile users' first stop on the internet and how they may think about sharing from there, which is very different than on the desktop.

‌It is important to note that neither Chrome or Safari has support for extensions or add-ons as they do on the desktop and with which users may be used to using. This lack of support is significant because it may hamper development on the browser as a platform, which otherwise is popular and well supported on the desktop. Extensions would allow bringing P2P directly to mobile potentially much more straightforward.

‌Several other mobile browsers do support extensions and could then support IPFS or P2P extensions more efficiently, such as Mozilla Firefox for Android. Also to note in regards to mobile browser support, the Cliqz browser has experimental support for the DAT P2P protocol, and Opera Mobile now supports IPFS.
