# Mobile Browser Survey

To investigate mobile P2P interaction for IPFS we surveyed the two most prominent and widely used mobile browsers, Android's Chrome and iOS's Safari, both of which are the default browsers, and thus most likely to be used.

It is important to note that neither has support for extensions or add-ons, which would allow bringing P2P directly to mobile potentially drastically easier. This lack of browser extension support is important because it severely hampers development on the browser as a platform, which otherwise is popular and well supported on the desktop, showing the drastic difference in accessability for users of P2P. This is highlighted by showing how users share from the mobile browser, an common use case on desktop, but much different on mobile.

There are a number of other mobile browsers that do support extensions and could then support IPFS or P2P extensions, such as Mozilla Firefox for mobile. Also to note in regards to mobile browser support, the Cliqz browser has experimental support for the DAT P2P protocol, and Opera Mobile now supports IPFS.
