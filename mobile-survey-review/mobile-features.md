# Mobile Features

The spread of applications in the P2P space on mobile is sparse, but this could be to limit testing to only fully released software versions available on app stores or through mobile web. The chosen applications in the Mobile Survey all share P2P as the transport layer but vary drastically in feature sets, showing some areas to investigate use patterns. The applications are spread across three main areas of use, messaging, posting or community boards, with some having all three and others only one.

|  | Messaging | Posting | File sharing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**ManyVerse**](mobile-survey-review-1/manyverse.md) | Straight forward messaging capabilities with familiary and standard FB-style chat UI, but confusing how profiles and accounts are handled | Users can write a public message to which they can post an image or text. Does not have support for other file formats. | File posting \(images only\) and transfer is done through chat or public post interface |
| [**Sharedrop.io**](mobile-survey-review-1/sharedrop.io.md) |  |  | File transfer done through web UI requiring sending link or QR code |
| [**Status**](mobile-survey-review-1/status.md) | Private direct messages with other users without request | Posting of messages to public chat rooms, no images or files supported | No native, in-app support, but can load dApps that can transfer files |
| [**FrostWire**](mobile-survey-review-1/frostwire.md) |  |  | Torrent UI featuring search, file and download management |
| [**uTorrent**](mobile-survey-review-1/utorrent-mobile.md) |  |  | No in-app search, can connect with desktop app, download and file management |
| [**Haven**](mobile-survey-review-1/haven.md) | Private direct messages with other users without request, no file transfer | Users can post items for sale which can include images, but users can not directly post images to each other |  |
