# Mobile Sharing Interaction

One of the most typical sharing and receiving interactions on mobile devices mentioned in the research interviews is sharing photos. While sharing songs and videos is also common, it is usually not done by sending the actual file from device to device. Instead, it is typically done by using a messaging app to send a link to an audio or videos streaming service such as YouTube.

## Key findings

* Messaging is the primary method of sharing or sending files such as photos
* iOS and Android both share common patterns in how a user can share files on their mobile devices such as photos, which is find and select photo -&gt; choose messaging app -&gt; add contact -&gt; add message -&gt; send
* AirDrop is quite possibly the simplest sharing pattern with the fewest steps. This is facilitated with using devices of the some type \(Apple\) and already connected with each other. This means that each device has an ID already and the user clicks and it sends to them. It is also important to note, that the end user does not need to verify the sending of the photo meaning its seamless and just appears in the photos gallery.
