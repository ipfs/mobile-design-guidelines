# Mobile Application Recommendations

## ManyVerse

| Finding | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Connection status is not shown when the user logs in, they need to go to Connections screen | Provide quick and temporary alert telling the user their connection status |
| Identity and accounts not handled with a typical login and password | Show the user how other types of identity and holding of accounts work with an additional informational screen |
| Syncing status of content is not made apparent to the user  | If there is a syncing ability in the app, the user should be notified of its status and allow them to cancel if they want |
| There is no logout option unless the user closes the app | If the user needs to sign in, they should have the ability to sign out |
| Users can be connected to and sent images without confirmation | If chat allows for files like images to be sent, require confirmation to send for the user |
| When a new account is setup, there is no indication to the user that the account has been setup successfully | Show confirmation that profiles and other settings are done and okay |

## Sharedrop

| Finding | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Users are made aware of privacy and connection implications with sharing | Information needs to be provided in a succint way with links to further information |
| Users present on the network are each given a unique avatar and anonymous name | If there are multiple avatars or identities present, the user needs which is them |
| No progress indication where the user is at in the sharing process | Show the user how much more they have to complete any sharing interaction |
| Shows link and QR code to send or give to the other user | Give the user a way to share any links or codes in the UI directly |

## Status

* While the sign-on process is typical and smooth for a blockchain app, it might be confusing to those who just wish to use P2P without public and private keys and maintaining them
* Onboarding processes intros should always have an option to login directly
* Make the user aware if necessary that they will need to manage public and private encryption keys
* Discoverability in finding other users and being made known to them should be done in app whenever possible
* Chat functionality should meet user expectations in features, such as attaching images and files
* Fetching and syncing of files should be automatic and not require addtional interaction
* Posting messages to community chats or boards should happen from its own interface, and not from a contextual menu in a user to user chat screen
* Interactions around difficult to understand themes such as blockchain are helped with imagery

## FrostWire

* Any UI personlisation should happen in hidden options, not during onboarding
* Separate different types of file transfers visually but present together, for instance downloading and seeding
* Useful for mobile downloads of music and video, but probably not for teams use and collaboration

## uTorrent Mobile

* If giving the user the option to search and discover, use the native app and not an external web site
* Don't provide any additional functionality that isn't related to the core functionality of the app
* Global app navigation should be for functionality and not second-order functionality like filtering
* Only show granular details of details if helps the user

## Haven

* Tell the user as quickly as possible what the application does and what it means for them
* Don't provide to the user multiple, unrelated places where they can do the same actions
* Initiating chats without invites or acceptances which could be a privacy concern for many users
* Don't use design patterns from other operating systems, it might confuse users not familiar with them

## Fairdrop

* If the user needs to have an account, they need to be told why and what benefit it has
* Keep interaction as simple as possible
* If a link needs to be sent, allow the user to send via OS level features
